## 👋 Welcome!
  We’re using Project Board and Discussions as a place to connect with our customers and our community. We hope that you:
  * Discover what we're currently focused
  * Ask questions you’re wondering about.
  * Share ideas.
  * Engage with other community members.
  * Welcome new products and help us enhance them by contributing feedbacks. Remember that this is a community we
  build together 💪.

Please keep in mind this is not a replacement for customer support

## Clever Cloud Roadmap

We share a Public Roadmap board  to communicate on some projects or features we're working on, but also to get feedback from early stages (like Technical Previews, Alphas, Betas, ...) through issues.

## How it works?

We provide both a Roadmap board and a Discussions forum : 

With he Roadmap board: 
- You can **identify 🔍 planned features** from our backlog
- You can **watch 👀 for specific features** and get notified about progress
- You can **comment ✏️ or vote 👍** for listed features

With Discussions (e.g. feedback, bugs, Technical Previews):
- You can **make a feedback** on a product or feature
- You can **discuss** with teams to get clarification or get help
- You can **comment ✏️ or vote 👍** for listed features
- You can **suggest 💓 features and ideas 💡** to the backlog 
- You can follow **Announces 📢 **

## Product and Feature lifecycle
- **Technical Previews** are used to developp product with very early feedback from customers. It can be Proof of Concepts. They're private with specific onboarding and offboarding. There is no customer support yet.
- **Alphas** are used to open a preview of a product, where everything is probably not there yet. It can be private or public. There is no customer support yet.
- **Betas** are used to refine a product to gain maturity before being considered for Production use. All basic fonctionnalities are there and products are billed. Customer support available.
- **GA** (globaly Available) marks products mature enough for production use. Customer support available for premium subscribtions.  

## Roadmap Workflow
- New Discussions regarding features will be considered usually within few a week and may enter the **Backlog** if they align with our product strategy.
- We regularly commit new items on the backlog. "**Planned**" column means the feature has been planned to be delivered for the next months.
- Features then follow a lifeycle and are moved to the corresponding stage. It may be "**Technical Preview**", "**Alpha**", "**Beta**" or just closed if it's been directly integrated on the platform.
- We will keep new features for a couple of months after their release in the "**Changelog**" column for follow-up.

## Contribute a feedback or an idea or propose a feature
- You can use this Discussions forum using the right category and consult existing feedback 🔍
- If you want to contribute a feedback ✍️, open a new discussion using the right category, then describe your experience. We accept both positive and negative feedback, but to help us best, try to be the most constructive 
- You can use the Ideas 💡 forum to propose some features. This thread will be used to discuss with the team to qualify the feature so that it will be added to our Backlog or eventually rejected.
- You can start a new Discussion to fill a bug 🐛report and describe the issue you're facing.
- Don't hesitate to share how Clever Cloud is a success for your use case 💓
