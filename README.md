## 👋 Welcome!
  We’re using Project Board and Discussions as a place to connect with our customers and our community. We hope that you:
  * Discover what we're currently focused on
  * Ask questions you’re wondering about.
  * Share ideas💡.
  * Engage with other community members.
  * Welcome new products and help us enhance them by contributing feedbacks. Remember that this is a community we
  build together 💪.

Please keep in mind this is not a replacement for customer support

## How it works?

With Discussions forums (e.g. feedback, bugs, Technical Previews):
- You can **make a feedback** on a product or feature
- You can **discuss** with teams to get clarification or get help
- You can **comment ✏️ or vote 👍** for listed features
- You can **suggest 💓 features and ideas 💡** to the backlog 
- You can follow **Announces 📢**

## Product and Feature lifecycle
- **Technical Previews** are used to developp product with very early feedback from customers. It can be Proof of Concepts. They're private with specific onboarding and offboarding. There is no customer support yet.
- **Alphas** are used to open a preview of a product, where everything is probably not there yet. It can be private or public. There is no customer support yet.
- **Betas** are used to refine a product to gain maturity before being considered for Production use. All basic fonctionnalities are there and products are billed. Customer support available.
- **GA** (globaly Available) marks products mature enough for production use. Customer support available for premium subscriptions.  

## Contribute a feedback or an idea or suggest a feature
- You can use the Discussions forum using the right category and consult existing feedback 🔍

- You can use the Ideas 💡 forum to suggest some features. This thread will be used to discuss with the team to qualify the feature so that it will be added to our Backlog or eventually rejected.
